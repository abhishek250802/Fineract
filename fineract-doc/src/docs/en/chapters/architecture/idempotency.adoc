= Idempotency

Idempotency is the way to make sure your specific action is only executed once.
For example, if you have a button that is supposed to send a repayment, you donâ€™t want to repayment twice if the user clicks the button twice. Idempotency is a way to make sure that the action is only executed once.

There are two ways to use idempotency:

  * HTTP Request with idempotency key header
  * Batch request with batch item header

== How it works

The `idempotency key` with `action name` and `entity name` is unique, and identify a specific command in the system.
If no idempotency key is assigned to the request, the system will generate one for you.

1. User send a request
2. The system checks there are already executed commands with the same `idempotency key` and `action name` and `entity name`
3. The action based on the result of the check
  * If the request is completed the system return with the already generated result
  * If not completed, return HTTP 409 response
  * If the request is not completed, we process the requests and store the results in the database


== Idempotency in HTTP requests

To achieve idempotency in HTTP requests, you can use the HTTP header from `fineract.idempotency-key-header-name` configuration variables (default `Idemptency-Key`). This header is a unique identifier for the request. If you send the same request twice, the second request will be ignored and the response from the first request will be returned.

== Idempotency in Batch requests

In batch requests, you can set the idempotency key for every batch item, in the batch item `header` fields. The header key is from `fineract.idempotency-key-header-name` configuration variables (default `Idemptency-Key`).

== Result of the request

* When the request is already executed and completed, the system will return a `x-served-from-cache` header with the value `true` in the response and return the original request body.
* When the request is already executed but still not completed, the system will return to HTTP 409 error code
* When the request is not executed, the system runs it normally and stores the result in the date
