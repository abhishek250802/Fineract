= Custom Business Steps

It very easy to add your own business steps to Fineract's default steps:

1. Create a custom module (e. g. `custom/acme/steps`, follow the instructions on how to create a custom module)
2. Create a class that implements interace `org.apache.fineract.cob.COBBusinessStep`
3. Provide the custom database migration to add the necessary information about your business step in table `m_batch_business_steps`

As you can see this implementation is very simple and doesn't do much. There are some simple conventions though that you should follow implementing your own business steps:

1. Make sure the value returned by method `getEnumStyledName()` is unique; it's a good idea to choose a prefix that reflects the name of your organization (in this example `ACME_`)
2. You have more freedom for the value returned by `getHumanReadableName()`, but it's a good idea to keep this value as unique as possible
